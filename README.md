Medical Chatbot 
This project presents an AI powered medical bot implemented using Python, with tools such as
Ollama, BitsAndBytes, Accelerate, and Gradio. The system provides an interface where users
input important information such as age, gender, and a description of their symptoms. The
project eciently processes the data provided by the user by using large natural language
processing and optimization frameworks ensuring accurate collection and analysis. The
interface is developed with Gradio, and it prioritizes simplicity and usability, allowing seamless
interaction. This project aims to collect patient data, reduce manual effort in healthcare settings,
and improve the eciency of medical triage processes, and it can also be used by users to get a
diagnosis. The implementation of AI frameworks and itâ€™s success in identifying the symptoms
show the potential for technology to address the challenges in healthcare systems.
